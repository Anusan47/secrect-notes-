# NestJS conversion of Secure Notes Backend

Auto-generated skeleton converted from an Express backend.

## Steps to run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values.

3. Run in dev:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

## Notes
- This conversion preserves Mongoose schemas and routes as Nest controllers/services.
- Validate and test endpoints; small manual fixes may be required for edge cases (file uploads, cron).
